Sum of Two Matrices:

Given two matrices A and B each of size N x M, print the sum of the matrices (A + B).

Note: 
 Try solving it by declaring only a single matrix.  Input Format
The first line of input contains N, M - the size of the matrices. It's followed by 2*N lines, each containing M integers - elements of the matrices. The first N lines are for matrix A and the next N lines are for matrix B.

Output Format
Print the sum of the 2 given matrices (A + B).

Constraints
1 <= N, M <= 100
-109 <= ar[i] <= 109

Example
Input
2 3
5 -1 3
19 8 4
4 5 -6
1 -2 12

Output
9 4 -3
20 6 16

code:
x,y = map(int,input().split())
m1 = []
for i in range(x):
    m1.append(list(map(int,input().split())))
m2 = []
for i in range(x):
    m2.append(list(map(int,input().split())))
sum = [] 
for j in range(x):
    c=[]
    for k in range(y):
        c.append(m1[j][k] + m2[j][k])
    sum.append(c)
for c in sum:
    print(*c)
