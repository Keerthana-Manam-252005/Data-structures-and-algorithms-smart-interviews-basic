Minimum Subtraction: 

Given a number N, find a number X. On subtracting X from N, N-X should be a power of 2. Find the minimum value of X.

Input Format
The first and only line of input contains an integer N.

Output Format
Print the value X.

Constraints
2 <= N <= 109

Example
Input
10

Output
2

Explanation
N = 10
If we subtract X = 2 from N = 10, N - X = 8 is a power of 2.

code:
import math
n = int(input())
power = 1
while power*2<=n:
    power*=2
x = n-power
print(x)
