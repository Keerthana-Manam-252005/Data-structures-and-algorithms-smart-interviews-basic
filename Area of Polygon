Area of Polygon:

Print the area of a given polygon. The polygon consists of N vertices (x1, y1), (x2, y2), …, (xN, yN). The vertices (xi, yi) and (xi+1, yi+1) are adjacent for i = 1, 2, …, N−1, and the vertices (x1, y1) and (xN, yN) are also adjacent.

Input Format
The first line of input has an integer N: the number of vertices. Next N lines describe the vertices. The ith such line has two integers xi and yi separated by space. You may assume that the polygon is simple, i.e., it does not intersect itself.

Output Format
Print the area of the Polygon.

Constraints
3 ≤ N ≤ 1000
-103 ≤ xi, yi ≤ 103

Example
Input
4
1 1
4 2
3 5
1 4

Output
16

code:
n = int(input())
points = [list(map(int,input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
area = 0
for i in range(n):
    x1,y1 = points[i]
    x2,y2 = points[(i+1)%n]
    area += (x1 * y2) - (x2 * y1)
print(abs(area))
