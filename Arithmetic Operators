Arithmetic Operators:

Given two integers A and B. Print the sum, difference, product, division, and remainder for the corresponding values of A and B.

Input Format
First and only line of input contains two integers - A and B.

Output Format
Print the sum, difference, product, division, and remainder for the corresponding values of A and B. Refer the given example.

Constraints
1 <= A, B <= 1000

Example
Input
12 5

Output
Sum: 17
Difference: 7
Product: 60
Division: 2
Remainder: 2

code:
x,y = map(int,input().split())
print(f"Sum:",x+y)
print(f"Difference:",x-y)
print(f"Product:",x*y)
print(f"Division:",x//y)
print(f"Remainder:",x%y)
