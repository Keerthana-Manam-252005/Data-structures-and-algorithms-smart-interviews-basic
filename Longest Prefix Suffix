Longest Prefix Suffix:

Given a string, compute the length of the longest proper prefix which is same as the suffix of the given string.

Input Format
The input contains a string S, consisting of only lowercase characters.

Output Format
Print the length of the longest proper prefix which is the same as a suffix of the given string.

Constraints
1 <= len(S) <= 100

Example
Input
smartintsmart

Output
5

code:
def longest_prefix_sum(s):
    n = len(s)
    lps = [0]*n
    length = 0
    i = 1
    while i<n:
        if s[i]==s[length]:
            length+=1
            lps[i]=length
            i+=1
        else:
            if length!=0:
                length = lps[length-1]
            else:
                lps[i] = 0
                i+=1
    return lps[-1]
s = input().strip()
print(longest_prefix_sum(s))
