A B and X:

You are given two numbers A and B along with an integer X. In one operation you can do one of the following: 
Set A = A + X and B = B - X 
Set A = A - X and B = B + X
Determine if you can make A and B equal after applying the operation any number of times (possibly zero). 

Input Format
 The first and only line of input contains three integers A, B, and X separated by a space.

Output Format
 For each test case, print YES if you can make A and B equal, otherwise NO. 

Constraints
 1 <= A, B, X <= 109

Examples
Input 1
 6 8 1

Output 1
 YES

Input 2
 15 16 2

Output 2
 NO

Explanation
 Example 1: The initial values of (A, B) are (6,8). We can perform the following operation.
 A = A + X = 6 + 1 = 7 and B = B - X = 8 - 1 = 7 
 A and B are equal, print YES.
 Example 2: It can be proven that we cannot make A equal to B using the given operations.

code:
a,b,x=map(int,input().split())
if abs(a-b)%(2*x)==0:
    print("YES")
else:
    print("NO")
