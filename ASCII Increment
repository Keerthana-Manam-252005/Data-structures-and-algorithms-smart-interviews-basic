ASCII Increment:

Given a string S, replace each character in the string S with the character that is K positions ahead of it in the ASCII sequence.

Note: 
If K causes a character to go beyond 'z' or 'Z', wrap around to 'a' or 'A' respectively.  Input Format
The first line of input contains string S, consisting of lowercase and uppercase characters. The second line contains K - an integer representing how many positions each character in the string should be shifted forward in the ASCII sequence.

Output Format
Print the transformed string.

Constraints
1 <= len(S) <= 100
0 <= K <= 100

Example
Input
LeaRn
4

Output
PieVr

code:
S = input()
k = int(input())
ans = ''
for i in S:
    if 'a'<=i<='z':
        new_ch = chr(((ord(i)-ord('a')+k)%26)+ord('a'))
    elif 'A'<=i<='Z':
        new_ch = chr(((ord(i)-ord('A')+k)%26)+ord('A'))
    else:
        new_ch = i
    ans+= new_ch
print(ans)
