Compress String:

Given a string, compress the given string. See the example for more details.

Input Format
Input contains a string S, consisting of lowercase and uppercase characters.

Output Format
Print the compressed string.

Constraints
1 <= len(S) <= 100

Example
Input
aaabbbbhhheaaAsssssss

Output
a3b4h3e1a2A1s7

Explanation
In the given string, a is repeating for 3 times - after compression a3.
Similarly,
b is repeating for 4 times - b4
h is repeating for 3 times - h3
e is repeating for 1 time - e1
a is repeating for 2 times - a2
A is repeating for 1 time - A1
s is repeating 7 times - s7

code:
s1 = input()
l = []
count=1
for i in range(1,len(s1)):
    if s1[i]==s1[i-1]:
        count+=1
    else:
        l.append(s1[i-1])
        l.append(count)
        count=1
l.append(s1[-1])
l.append(count)
for i in l:
    print(i,end="")
