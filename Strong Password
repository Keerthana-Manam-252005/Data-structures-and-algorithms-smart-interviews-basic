Strong Password:

Find the minimum number of characters to add to a password (P) to ensure that P meets the following criteria:
1. Contains at least 6 characters.
2. Contains at least one digit.
3. Contains at least one lowercase character.
4. Contains at least one uppercase character.
5. Contains at least one special character (!@#$%^&*()-+).

Input Format
First and only line of input contains a string P.

Output Format
Print the minimum number of characters that has to be added to P.

Constraints
1 <= len(P) <=50
P[i] ∈ {[a-z], [A-Z], [0-9], or [!@#$%^&*()-+ ]}.

Example
Input
He!!0

Output
1

Explanation
The given password P already contains one digit, one lowercase character, one uppercase character and one special character. However, it should also contain at least 6 characters. 
So we need to add 1 character to ensure it meets all the criteria.

code:
p = input().strip()
has_digit = any(c.isdigit() for c in p)
has_lower = any(c.islower() for c in p)
has_upper = any(c.isupper() for c in p)
has_special = any(c in '!@#$%^&*()-+' for c in p)
missing_types=0
if not has_digit:
    missing_types += 1
if not has_lower:
    missing_types += 1
if not has_upper:
    missing_types += 1
if not has_special:
    missing_types += 1
ans = max(missing_types,6-len(p)) 
print(ans)
