Image Flip:

You are given an N x M binary matrix called "image". You need to perform the following operations on the matrix (in order) and return the resulting image:Flip the image horizontally: This involves reversing the 
order of elements in each row of the matrix. For example, [1,0,1,0,0,0] becomes [0,0,0,1,0,1]Invert the image: This involves replacing 0s with 1s and 1s with 0s in the entire matrix. For example, [0,0,0,1,0,1] 
becomes [1,1,1,0,1,0]

Input Format
Line of input contains N - number of rows and M - number of columns. The next N lines contains M integers each denoting the elements of the matrix image.

Output Format
You have to print the resultant matrix image.

Constraints
1 <= N <=100
1 <= M <=100

Example
Input
2 2
1 0
0 1

Output
1 0
0 1

code:
def image_flip(matrix):
    for rows in matrix:
        rows.reverse()
        for i in range(len(rows)):
            rows[i] = 1-rows[i]
    return matrix
m,n = map(int,input().split())
matrix = []
for i in range(m):
    row = list(map(int,input().split()))
    matrix.append(row)
res = image_flip(matrix)
for i in res:
    print(' '.join(map(str,i)))
