Alternate Seating:

You are given an integer N, denoting the number of people who need to be seated, and a list of M seats, where 0 represents a vacant seat and 1 represents an already occupied seat. Find whether all N people can find a seat, provided that no two people can sit next to each other.

Input Format
The first line of the input contains N denoting the number of people. The second line of input contains M denoting the number of seats. The third line of input contains the seats.

Output Format
If all N people can find seats, print YES otherwise NO.

Constraints
1 ≤ N ≤ 105
1 ≤ M ≤ 105
Ai ∈ {0, 1}

Example

0 0 1 0 0 0 1

Output
YES

Explanation

The two people can sit at index 0 and 4.

code:
n = int(input())
m = int(input())
seats = list(map(int,input().split()))
for i in range(m):
    if seats[i]==0:
        prev_seat = seats[i-1] if i>0 else 0
        next_seat = seats[i+1] if i<m-1 else 0
        if prev_seat==0 and next_seat==0:
            seats[i]=1
            n-=1
            if n==0:
                print('YES')
                break
else:
    print('NO')
