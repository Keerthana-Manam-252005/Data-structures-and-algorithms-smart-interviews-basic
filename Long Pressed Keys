Long Pressed Keys:

Observing your friend as they type their name on the keyboard, you notice that occasionally a key might be held down longer, causing a character to appear multiple times. After examining the sequence of typed 
characters, determine whether it's possible that the typed sequence corresponds to your friend's name. Print true if typed_name corresponds to your friend_name, otherwise print false.

Input Format
The first and only line of input contains two strings separated by space.

Output Format
Print true if typed_name corresponds to your friend_name, otherwise print false.

Constraints
1 ≤ len(friend_name), len(typed_name) ≤ 3000

Example
Input
raju rrraaajjjjjjjjjjjjjjuuuu

Output
true

code:
def long_pressed_keys(friend_name, typed_name):
    i,j = 0,0
    n,m = len(friend_name),len(typed_name)
    while j<len(typed_name):
        if i<len(friend_name) and friend_name[i]==typed_name[j]:
            i+=1
            j+=1
        elif j>0 and typed_name[j]==typed_name[j-1]:
            j+=1
        else:
            return 'false'
    return 'true' if i==len(friend_name) else 'false'
friend_name, typed_name = input().split()
print(long_pressed_keys(friend_name, typed_name))
