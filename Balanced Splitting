Balanced Splitting:

A balanced string is one that contains an equal quantity of 'L' and 'R' characters. Given a balanced string S, your task is to split it into some number of substrings such that each substring is also balanced.
Output the maximum number of balanced strings you can obtain through this splitting process.

Input Format
The first and only line of input contains string S.

Output Format
Print the maximum number of balanced strings you can obtain with the splitting process.

Constraints
2 ≤ len(A) ≤ 1000

Example
Input
LRRLLLLRRLRR

Output
3

Explanation
The string 'LRRLLLLRRLRR' can be split into three substrings: "LR", "RL" and "LLLRRLRR," each containing the same number of 'L' and 'R' characters.

code:
a = input()
l_c = 0
r_c = 0
balance_c = 0
for i in a:
    if i=='L':
        l_c+=1
    elif  i=='R':
        r_c+=1
    if l_c==r_c:
        balance_c+=1
        l_c=0
        r_c=0
print(balance_c)
