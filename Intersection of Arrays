Intersection of Arrays:

Given two arrays of size N and M respectively, print the unique elements that appear in both arrays.
Note: The order of elements in the output must follow their first occurrence in the first array.

Input Format
The first line of input contains N - the size of the first array, followed by the elements of the first array. The next line contains a single integer M - the size of the second array, followed by the elements of the second array.

Output Format
Print the unique elements that appear in both arrays separated by a space.

Constraints
1 <= N, M <= 1000
-1000Â <= ar[i] <= 1000

Example
Input
8
4 1 5 9 3 4 8 9
6
6 4 9 4 8 1

Output
4 1 9 8

Explanation
The unique elements present in both the arrays are - 4, 1, 9, 8.

code:
N = int(input())
a = list(map(int,input().split()))
M = int(input())
b = list(map(int,input().split()))
s = set(b)
res = []
seen = set()
for i in a:
    if i in s and i not in seen:
        res.append(i)
        seen.add(i)
print(*res)
